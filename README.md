This is based on [this commit in test-nn-c](https://github.com/winksaville/test-nn-c/commit/5ca27097024ce857041b5a9773a86a91617724a0)
which is from branch Make-compatible-with-test-nn-ts. The code is originally
based on the [Step by Step Guide to Implementing a Neural Network in C](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/INC/nn.html)
by [John A. Bullinaria](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/).
