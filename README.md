# A simple artificial neural network library in C

Based on the [Step by Step Guide to Implementing a Neural Network in C](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/INC/nn.html)
by [John A. Bullinaria](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/). My copy of that code with modification is [here](https://github.com/winksaville/bullinaria-nn). The back propagation code is based on code from [Karsten Kutza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karstenkutza) with my copy of that code [here](https://github.com/winksaville/kutza-nn).
